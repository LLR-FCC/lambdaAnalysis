## Z-boson decays into an invisible massless dark photon at FCC-ee

### Abstract

We study the decay of the Z vector boson into a photon and a massless (invisible) dark photon at FCC ee. 
The photon can be used as a trigger for the event, while the dark photon is detected indirectly as missing momentum in the event final state.
The main irreducible bakground comes from the process e+e− → Z γ → νν ̄γ, whose impact can be reduced by cutting on the detected photon energy.
This process can be affected by additional background contamination in the presence of crack regions of the detector: their existence can indeed 
increase the impact of the otherwise 1/s suppressed background from e+e− → l+ l-  γ , where either leptons are not detected. 
The best result found for the lepton collider running at the Z mass shows a final sensitivity to branching ratios of order O(10-11) in the absence of crack regions. 
We also discuss how to use the photon angular distribution of the events in lepton collisions to discriminate between the dark photon and a pseudoscalar state like the axion.
