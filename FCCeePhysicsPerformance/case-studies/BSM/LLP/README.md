mailing list: LLP-FCCee-informal@cern.ch

#### Interested people (evolving)
Rebeca Gonzalez Suarez(U.Uppsala), Rohini Sengupta(U.Uppsala), Patrizia Azzi (INFN-PD), Juliette Alimena(CERN), 
Sylvie Braibant-Giacomelli (U.Bologna), Valentina Diolaiti (U. Bologna), ... (42 members in the mailing list at th emoment of writing) 

#### Plan
- Evaluate Delphes capabilities for treatement of long lived particles on some simple events
- Adapt/modify Delphes to suit case-study goal
- Choose benchmark models to evaluate performance using Delphes 
- Extract preliminary detector requirement 

#### Software setup 

- Here information about specific setup for Delphes for LLP case 

#### Generator cards 

- Here information from specific benchmark models 

#### WIP
  - Valentina: study of the momentum resolution versus displacement building on top of previous work. Starting point could be a particle gun with muons in pythia generating a wide spectrum from prompt to 1,5 meters of distance from the collision point (the whole tracker) and see what happens.
  
 - Rohini: using setup from Suchita, try to generate samples with varying parameters, to then check how collimated the decay products of the RHN are and produce performance plots.
 
 - Emilia: using Suchita's files, prepare RHN event-display for CERN courier.
