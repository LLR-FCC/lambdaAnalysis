# Setting up lxplus enviornment

- [Lxplus setup](#lxplus-setup)
  * [Pre-requisits] (#prereq)
  * [LCG repositories](#lcg)


## Pre-requisits
The specific route taken for the project involves creating HNL samples and then using Delphes to understand the detector performances. In order to do that we use 
  * MadGraph
  * HNL model from here
  * Pythia8
  * Delphes
  * Delphes card from here (https://github.com/delphes/delphes/blob/master/cards/delphes_card_IDEAtrkCov.tcl). The card is suggested by Michele.
