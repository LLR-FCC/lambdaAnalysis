### Analysis code summary

The following scripts are used to run the variois steps of the offline analysis:
- `user_config.py`: paths and common variables.
- `decay_mode_xs.py`: definitions of the branching ratios and cross-sections for the exclusive B-hadron modes considered as background.
- `process_sig_bkg_samples_for_xgb.py`: awkward array conversion of ROOT files to pandas data frames used in stage 1 xgboost training. Output stored in pickle files.
- `train_xgb.py`: train first stage BDT.
- `train_xgb_stage2.py`: train second stage BDT.
- `fit_MVA_dists.py`: fit the two MVA distributions above 0.95 in a summed sample of exclusive background. This is used to create cubic splines for accurate cut efficiency determination in the optimisation.
- `estimate_purity.py`: run the 2D cut optimisation procedure to determine best purity for a given set of cuts, and the signal and background yield at those cuts. Persists output to dictionary in JSON.
- `make_selected_samples_for_templates.py`: create files for signal and background passing tight BDT cuts, which are then used to make templates for the fit. Files are written as pandas dataframes in pickle.
- `template_fit.py`: run toy fits to measure the signal yield for a given number of Z‚Äôs. Can run with one toy to plot, or with many for toy studies of signal yield precision and bias.
- `analyse_toys.py`: gather toy fit results and look at the distribution of fitted signal yields. Use this to determine the overall signal yield uncertainty expected.
- `calc_BFs.py`: calculate branching ratios and their precisions for different number of Z's. Plot the trends in signal yield, branching fraction ratio, and branching fraction vs. number of Z's.

A few scripts are also used to generate plots and tables for the paper:
- `plot_xgb.py`: plot the BDT distributions from first stage training and the efficiency profiles
- `plot_xgb_stage2.py`: plot the BDT distributions from second stage training and the efficiency profiles
- `exclusive_bkg_summary_table.py`: summarise the exclusive background statistics and efficiencies for the paper in a table.
- `plot_max_hem_E.py`: plot charged vs neutral maximum hemisphere energies in signal and background, which are shown in paper.
- `make_signal_yield_table.py`: make a table for the paper showing signal yields and uncertainties for different number of Z's.
- `make_yield_BF_summary_tables.py`: make summary tables of yield and branching fraction precision as a function of number of Z's.
