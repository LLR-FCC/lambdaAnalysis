### Abstract

The Z peak cross section sigma^0_had can be measured at FCC-ee with hadronic and dimuon events produced at s = 91.2GeV, with a potential relative statistical precision of O(1e-6). Together with the ratio Rl, this quantity allows the determination of the number of light neutrino types with a precision of 0.0004. A limiting systematic uncertainty comes from the absolute determination of the integrated luminosity. A determination with low-angle Bhabha scattering is likely to be limited by a relative theoretical precision of O(1e−4), but that might not be the case for **large angle diphoton production, e+e− → γγ** (to be checked with actual full two-loop calculations). The requirements on the detector design to measure the absolute luminosity with diphoton events, and in particular to **separate these events from the large angle Bhabha background**, will be studied, in synergy with the lepton acceptance studies required for Rl.
