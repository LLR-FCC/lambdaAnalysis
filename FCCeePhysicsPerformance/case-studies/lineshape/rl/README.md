### Abstract

The ratio Rl of the number of Z hadronic decays to the number of Z leptonic decays can be potentially measured at FCC-ee with a relative statistical precision of O(3 × 10−6) for each lepton type. It is a key quantity [4] that serves – in conjunction with the total Z decay width and the peak hadronic cross section – as input to several fundamental quantities: (i) the measurement of the leptonic Z partial width Γll, a very clean electroweak observable whose relation to the Z mass is the ρ (or T) parameter, and unaffected by αQED(m2Z), with a 10−5 relative precision; and (ii) the measurement of the strong coupling constant αS(m2Z) with an absolute experimental uncertainty below 0.0001. Experience from LEP showed that a limiting systematic uncertainty comes from the knowledge of the **geometrical acceptance for lepton pairs**. The requirements on the detector design to match the statistical precision will be studied in the full context of the constraints from the interaction region layout. As a by-product, the determination of the geometrical acceptance for the e+e− → γγ process, which may be used for the measurement of the absolute luminosity, potentially with a statistical precision of a few 10−5, will be investigated. The knowledge, at the same level of precision, of the acceptance for the more abundant hadronic Z decays, a much easier problem at LEP, will need to be verified.
