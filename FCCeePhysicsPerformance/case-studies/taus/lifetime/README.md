### Abstract

Precision measurements of τ lepton properties, its mass, lifetime, and leptonic branching fractions, provide interesting tests of lepton universality. 

At Z-pole energies, the τ lifetime is determined via measurement of the 2.2 mm average flight distance. A lifetime measurement matching the 1e−5 statistical precision would then correspond to a flight-distance measurement to a few tens of nanometers accuracy. Approaching as far as possible towards this limit imposes formidable requirements on the **accuracy of the construction and the alignment of the vertex detector**. With a 10–15 mm beam pipe radius, the first vertex detector layer will be very close to the beam line and an impact parameter resolution of about 3 μm looks feasible.
